### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the adopt-a-pet lab helped me a lot. I haven't worked with backend before, and the instructions on there were super helpful and easily crossed over into the project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have deployed the website. It's something I've been meaning to do with my other websites, I just haven't gotten the time to. Additionally, I would have tried to improve the UI/UX and make the website more personal to me (selling items I would purchase)

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I'm demoing my project tomorrow, but something that was really confusing for me were the milestones for this project. I thought the wording and implementation was confusing and that hindered my progress a lot.
